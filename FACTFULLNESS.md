## Introduction
### Short Summary
* Hans Rosling starts with a test asking the reader 13 questions about the condition of the world in order to show how bad our sense for the current condition of the world acutally is. These are questions like *"How did the number of deaths due to natural disasters develop in the last 100 years?"* or *"Worldwide 30 year old men visited a school for 10 years on average. How many years did women of the same age visit school?"*
* Tells about what triggered his wish to spread data-based knowledge about the real condition of the world
  * As he started teaching International Health at Karolinska Institute in the mid ninetees he recognized that his studends had a distorted view on the different facts about the world
* He had three theories about what could be the reason for the misconceptions
  * *Missing knowledge* which could not be true as the answers in his questionaires were not randomly wrong but systematically wrong
  * *Outdated knowledge* which people got from the outdated knowledge from their teachers. This turned out to be wrong as even after his presentations people tended to have discussions that the data just cannot be true and the actual state of the world is worse
  * *Natural given over-dramatisation* proved to be the reason for the misconceptions. This he found was not mainly triggered by e.g. media but by the way our brain works  
* Tells about a reasearch project in 2017 where 1200 people in 14 countries were asked the 13 questions mentioned above. In average only 2 of 13 questions were answered right.  


### Really short summary
* Hans Rosling's passion for sharing data based knowledge was triggered by the misconception of his students about the condition of the world
* He found that the misconception was not because the lack of knowledge or outdated knowledge but by a over-dramatisation which is caused by the way our brain works
* Broad research in 2017 including 12000 people in 14 countries showed that the misconceptions does not differ in different areas or for different degrees of education

### Comments
I find some of the 13 questions asked are open for interpretation without more details. Two examples:
* *"What percentage of people worldwide can access electricity to a certain degree?"* - What does *"to a certain degree"* mean? Is this a fixed definition, e.g. being able to use a light bulb? Did this definition change over the years?
* *"How did the number of people worldwide living in extreme poverty develop in the past 20 years"* - How is *"extreme poverty"* defined? Is it agreed across the scientific world what it means? Did the definition change in the past 20 years? ...  

It seems that it is a simplified view on complex topics which allow different interpretations. Especially when answering the 13 questions I had the desire to ask a bunge of question in order be be able to answer them.  
This is the impression only having read the introduction. This might change in the next chapters.
